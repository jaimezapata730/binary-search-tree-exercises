# binary-search-tree-exercises
# insert
This function should insert a node in a binary tree. It should return the BinarySearchTree and should be solved using iteration.

# insertRecursively
This function should insert a node in a binary tree. It should return the BinarySearchTree and should be solved using recursion.

# find
This function should find a node in a binary tree. It should return the node if found, otherwise return undefined. This should be solved using iteration.

# findRecursively  
This function should find a node in a binary tree. It should return the node if found, otherwise return undefined. This should be solved using recursion.

# dfsPreOrder
This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using pre-order depth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.

# dfsInOrder
This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using in-order depth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.

# dfsPostOrder
This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using post-order depth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.

# bfs  
This function should search through each node in the binary search tree using breadth first search and return an array containing each node’s value.

--------------------------------------------
# remove
This function should remove a node from a binary search tree. Your remove function should be able to handle removal of the root node, removal of a node with one child and removal of a node with two children. The function should return the node removed.

# isBalanced  
Write a function which accepts a binary search tree and returns true if the tree is balanced, otherwise returns false.

# findSecondHighest
Write a function which accepts a BST and returns the second highest value.
